# Generic Sorting Algorithm in x86 Assembly

A sorting algorithm written in x86 Assembly using the Irvine32 library. Designed to sort an array of elements in ascending order.

## Features

- Supports sorting integers
- Efficient use of registers and memory
- Demonstrates low-level programming concepts

## Technologies Used

- x86 Assembly
- Irvine32 Library
- MASM (Microsoft Assembler)

## How to Run

1. Install MASM and Irvine32 library.
2. Assemble and link the `.asm` file.
3. Run the executable from command line or DOSBox.

## Notes

This project is educational, intended to improve understanding of sorting logic at the assembly level.
